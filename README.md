# Weather-App

I'm building a weather application using ReactJS and OpenWeather API with places autocomplete.

Used the **GeoDB** Cities API and the **OpenWeather** API.

Used the _npm_ packages **react-accessible-accordion** , **react-select-async-paginate**

=> **react-select-async-paginate** -> Alternate of Async, supports loading page by page

-> _debounceTimeout_ -> The amount of time the debounce function will wait after the last received action before executing function

-> Used the **react-accessible-accordion** npm package.
_allowZeroExpanded_ -> allows all accordian to be closed.
